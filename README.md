## Music Manager is an offline music & audio player with the ability to connect to SoulSeek.

Music Manager runs in Python3, so it's probably a good idea to like, get that.

Currently, there are several libraries which need to be installed in order for MusicManager to work (installation executable tbd). The pip installations of which are listed here:

```
pip install PyQt6
pip install mutagen
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install aioslsk
pip install qasync
pip install python-vlc
```

Additionally, **VLC media player must be installed in order for the program to work!**

As an offline music player, it works as well as you would want, you can drag and drop files, create playlists, etc.
