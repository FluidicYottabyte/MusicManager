Music Manager is an offline music & audio player with the ability to connect to SoulSeek.


Currently, there are several libraries which need to be installed through pip in order for MusicManager to work. I plan on listing them all here before eventually building a proper installer.


It is recommended you use Git in order to manage automatic update checks.

Current required pip libraries:

```pip install PyQt6
pip install mutagen
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install aioslsk
pip install qasync
pip install python-vlc```

Additionally, VLC media player must be installed in order for the program to function!
